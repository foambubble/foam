# How to Write Recipes

This is an example of how to structure a Recipe. The first paragraph or two should explain the purpose of the recipe succinctly, including why it's useful, if that's not obvious.

Recipes are intended to document:
- How to use Foam's basic features
- Power user pro-tips
- Useful customisations of the default Foam environment
- Integrations with third party tools and extensions (should be listed below)

## Required Extensions

 - **[Hacker Typer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jevakallio.vscode-hacker-typer)** (not really required for this recipe, just an example)
 - [Foam for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foam.foam-vscode) (installed by default)

The first section should be a bulleted list of extensions required to use this recipe. At a minimum, this section should list all additional, non-standard extensions.

Ideally, you should also note which Foam [[recommended-extensions]] are responsible for providing this feature, so any issue reports can be directed to the correct repositories. 

When creating new recipes, if you don't know which extension does what, you can leave it out.

## Instructions

Here we describe how the extension should be used.

You may include a screenshot or GIF of the feature in action by uploading an image to the `assets/images` directory. Please try to keep GIFs as small as possible by recording them with a low frame rate.

That's pretty much it!
