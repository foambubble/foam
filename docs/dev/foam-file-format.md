# Foam File Format

This file is an example of a valid Foam file. Essentially it's just a markdown file with a bit of additional support for mediawiki-style `[[wiki-links]]`.

Here are a few specific constraints, mainly because our tooling is a bit fragmented. Most of these should be eventually lifted, and our requirement should just be "Markdown with `[[wiki-links]]`:

- **The first top level `# Heading` will be used as title for the note.**
  - If not available, we will use the file name
- **File name should have extension `.md`**
  - This is a temporary limitation and will be lifted in future versions.
  - At least `.mdx` will be supported, but ideally we'll support any file that you can map to `Markdown` language mode in VS Code
- **In addition to normal Markdown Links syntax you can use `[[media-wiki]]` links.** See [[wiki-links]] for more details.
