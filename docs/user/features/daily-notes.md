# Daily Notes

Daily notes allow you to quickly create and access a note file for each day.

## Creating Daily Notes

- **Command:** `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Foam: Open Daily Note"
- **Shortcut:** `Alt+D`
- **Snippets:** Type `/today`, `/yesterday`, `/tomorrow` in any note

## Automatic Daily Notes

Open daily note automatically on VS Code startup:

```json
{
  "foam.openDailyNote.onStartup": true
}
```

## Daily Note Templates

Create `.foam/templates/daily-note.md` to customize the structure:

```markdown
---
type: daily-note
---

# Daily Note - $FOAM_DATE_YEAR-$FOAM_DATE_MONTH-$FOAM_DATE_DATE

## Date Snippets

Create links to recent daily notes using snippets:

| Snippet      | Date          |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| `/today`     | today         |
| `/tomorrow`  | tomorrow      |
| `/yesterday` | yesterday     |
| `/monday`    | next Monday   |
| `/+1d`       | tomorrow      |
| `/-3d`       | 3 days ago    |
| `/+1w`       | in a week     |
| `/-1m`       | one month ago |
| `/+1y`       | in one year   |

## Configuration

By default, daily notes are created as `yyyy-mm-dd.md` in the workspace's `journals` folder.

To customize your daily note location and format you can create a `.foam/templates/daily-note.md` template. See [[templates]] for more information.

There are also some settings to customize the behavior of daily notes, but they are deprecated and will be removed. Please use the `daily-note.md` template.
