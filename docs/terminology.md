# Terminology

It would be good to have some shared terminology to talk about Foam concepts. Some in-group terminology is acceptable, but we shouldn't be obtuse just to be exclusive.

Here's some ideas, these are open for discussion.

## Foam, the software project

The set of tools and ideas collected in this organisation.

## (Your) Foam

The directory/repository where you keep all your notes.

Also happens to sound quite a lot like Home. Funny, that.

## Bubble

Individual Foam note, written in Markdown.
