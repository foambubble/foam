[Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam) is a note-taking tool that lives within VsCode, which means you can pair it with your favorite extensions for a great editing experience.

Foam is open source, and allows you to create a local first, markdown based, personal knowledge base. You can also use it to publish your notes.

Foam is also meant to be extensible, so you can integrate with its internals to customize your knowledge base.

## Getting started

You really, _really_, **really** should read [Foam documentation](https://foambubble.github.io/foam), but if you can't be bothered, this is how to get started:

1. [Create a GitHub repository from foam-template](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/generate). If you want to keep your thoughts to yourself, remember to set the repository private.
2. Clone the repository and open it in VS Code.
3. When prompted to install recommended extensions, click **Install all** (or **Show Recommendations** if you want to review and install them one by one).

This will also install `Foam for VSCode`, but if you already have it installed, that's ok, just make sure you're up to date on the latest version.
