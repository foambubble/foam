# Using Foam

Foam is a collection VS Code extensions and recipes that power it up into a full-blown note taking system.
This folder contains user documentation describing how to get started using Foam, what its main features are, and strategies for getting the most out of Foam.
The full docs are included in the `foam-template` repo that most users start from.
