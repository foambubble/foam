# Architecture

This document aims to provide a quick overview of the Foam architecture!

Foam code and documentation live in the monorepo at [foambubble/foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/).
- [/docs](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/tree/master/docs): documentation and [[recipes]].
- [/packages/foam-core](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/tree/master/packages/foam-core) - Powers the core functionality in Foam across all platforms.
- [/packages/foam-vscode](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/tree/master/packages/foam-vscode) - The core VSCode plugin.
- [/packages/foam-cli](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/tree/master/packages/foam-cli) - The Foam CLI tool.

Exceptions to the monorepo are:
- The starter template at [foambubble/foam-template](https://github.com/foambubble/)
- All other [[recommended-extensions]] live in their respective GitHub repos.
