# Images from your Clipboard

You can directly link and paste images that are copied to the clipboard using either the [Paste
Image](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mushan.vscode-paste-image)
extension, or the [Markdown Image](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hancel.markdown-image) extension. The former does not have MDX support (yet), the latter does.
