# Note Properties

At the top of the file you can have a section where you define your properties. This section is known as the [Front-Matter](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll/introduction-to-jekyll-front-matter/) of the document and uses the YAML formatting.

> Be aware that this section needs to be at the very top of the file to be valid

For example, for this file, we have:

```markdown
---
type: feature
keywords: hello world
---
```

This sets the `type` of this document to `feature` and sets **two** keywords for the document: `hello world`, and `bonjour`. There are two keywords being set because the YAML parser will treat multiple items as being separated by commas instead of spaces.

> You can set as many custom properties for a document as you like, but there are a few [special properties](#special-properties) defined by Foam.

## Special Properties

Some properties have special meaning for Foam:

- the `title` property will assign the name to the note that you will see in the graph, regardless of the filename or the first heading (also see how to [[write-notes-in-foam]])
- The `type` property can be used to style notes differently in the graph (also see [[graph-visualization]]). The default type for a document is `note` unless otherwise specified with this property.
- The `tags` property can be used to add tags to a note (see [[tags]])

## Template Properties

- There also exists properties that are even more specific to Foam [[Note Templates]]
  - `filepath`
  - `name`
  - `description` [[todo]] fillout

```markdown
---
foam_template:
    filepath: "/home/user/foam-template/$FOAM_DATE_YEAR$FOAM_DATE_MONTH$FOAM_DATE_DATE$FOAM_DATE_HOUR$FOAM_DATE_MINUTE $FOAM_TITLE.md"
    name: 
    description: This is a description of a note
