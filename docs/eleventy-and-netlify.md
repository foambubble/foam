# Eleventy and Netlify

Take your Foam bubbles and create a static site with Eleventy and host it online on Netlify. 

Start by using this [template](https://github.com/juanfrank77/foam-eleventy-template) to create your new site.

With it, you have control over what to publish and what to keep private. Also you can customize the styling of the site to your own liking.

## Publishing your foam

When you're ready to publish. First, you have to import the GitHub repository of this workspace into your Netlify account. (Create one if you don't have it already.)

Once that's done, all you have to do is add the changes you want and push them to the main branch. Netlify will recognize the changes, deploy them automatically and give you a link where your Foam is published.

That's it! You can now see it online and use that link to share it with your friends so that they can see it too.
