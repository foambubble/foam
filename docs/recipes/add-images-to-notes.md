# Add images to your notes

This #recipe allows you to paste images on to your notes.

You can directly link and paste images that are copied to the clipboard using either the [Paste
Image](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mushan.vscode-paste-image)
extension, or the [Markdown Image](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hancel.markdown-image) extension.

The former does not have MDX support (yet), the latter does.
