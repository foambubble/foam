# Contributing

Hello, friend.

This repository is a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) managed by [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/).

- The [packages](packages/) directory contains all Foam core code packages
- The [docs](docs/) directory contains a Foam workspace that hosts the official [documentation site](https://foambubble.github.io/foam)

The foam starter template lives outside of this repository at [foambubble/foam-template](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template).

See [Foam Contribution Guide](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/contribution-guide) on the rendered Foam workspace for more information on how to contribute to Foam.

Thank you for your interest!
