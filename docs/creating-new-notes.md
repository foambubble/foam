# Creating New Notes

- Write out a new `[[wiki-link]]` and `Cmd` + `Click` to create a new file and enter it.
  - For keyboard navigation, use the 'Follow Definition' key `F12` (or [remap key binding](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings) to something more ergonomic)
- `Cmd` + `Shift` + `P` (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` for Windows), execute `New Note` from [VS Code Markdown Notes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes) and enter a **Title Case Name** to create `title-case-name.md`
  - Add a keyboard binding to make creating new notes easier.
- You shouldn't worry too much about categorising your notes. You can always [[search-for-notes]], and explore them using the [[graph-visualisation]].
