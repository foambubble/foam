# Eleventy and Netlify

You can use [foam-eleventy-template](https://github.com/juanfrank77/foam-eleventy-template) to generate a static site with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), and host it online on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). 

With this template you can
- Have control over what to publish and what to keep private 
- Customize the styling of the site to your own liking

## Publishing your foam

When you're ready to publish, import the GitHub repository you created with **foam-eleventy-template** into your Netlify account. (Create one if you don't have it already.)

Once that's done, all you have to do is make changes to your workspace in VS Code and push them to the main branch on GitHub. Netlify will recognize the changes, deploy them automatically and give you a link where your Foam is published.


That's it!

You can now see it online and use that link to share it with your friends, so that they can see it too.
