# Git integration

There are (too) many ways to commit your changes to source control:

- Using VS Code's own git integration
- Using GitLens (included in Foam for inline blame)
- Whatever way you like to do it (CLI?)

The quick and easy way is to use the Git: Commit All command after editing files. The default Foam workspace settings will stage & sync all of your changes to the remote:

- `Cmd` + `Shift` + `P` (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` for Windows), execute `Git: Commit All`

This could be improved. [[todo]] [[good-first-task]]

[todo]: todo "Todo"
[good-first-task]: good-first-task "Good First Task"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
