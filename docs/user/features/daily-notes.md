# Daily Notes

Daily notes allow you to quickly create and access a new notes file for each day. This is a surpisingly effective and increasingly common strategy to organize notes and manage events.

View today's note file by running the `Foam: Open Daily Note` command, by using the shortcut `alt+d` (note: shortcuts can be [overridden](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings)), or by using [#snippets](#Snippets). The name, location, and title of daily notes files is [#configurable](#Configuration).

## Roam-style Automatic Daily Notes

You can automatically open today's note on startup by setting the `Foam â€º Open Daily Note: On Startup` setting to `true`.

## Daily Note Templates

Daily notes can also make use of [[Note Templates]], by defining a special `.foam/templates/daily-note.md` template.

## Snippets

Create a link to a recent daily note using [snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets). Type `/today` and press `enter` to link to today's note. You can also write:

| Snippet      | Date          |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| `/tomorrow`  | tomorrow      |
| `/yesterday` | yesterday     |
| `/monday`    | next Monday   |
| `/+1d`       | tomorrow      |
| `/-3d`       | 3 days ago    |
| `/+1w`       | in a week     |
| `/-1m`       | one month ago |
| `/+1y`       | in one year   |

## Configuration

By default, Daily Notes will be created in a file called `yyyy-mm-dd.md` in the workspace's `journals` folder, with a heading `yyyy-mm-dd`.

These settings can be overridden in your workspace or global `.vscode/settings.json` file, using the [**dateformat** date masking syntax](https://github.com/felixge/node-dateformat#mask-options):

It's possible to customize path and heading of your daily notes, by following the [dateformat masking syntax](https://github.com/felixge/node-dateformat#mask-options).
The following properties can be used:

```json
  "foam.openDailyNote.directory": "journal",
  "foam.openDailyNote.filenameFormat": "'daily-note'-yyyy-mm-dd",
  "foam.openDailyNote.fileExtension": "mdx",
  "foam.openDailyNote.titleFormat": "'Journal Entry, ' dddd, mmmm d",
```

The above configuration would create a file `journal/daily-note-2020-07-25.mdx`, with the heading `Journal Entry, Sunday, July 25`.

> NOTE: It is possible to set the filepath of a daily note according to the date using the special [[note-properties]] configurable for [[Note Templates]]. Specifically see [[note-templates#Example of date-based|Example of date-based filepath]]. Using the template property will override any setting configured through `.vscode/settings.json`.
