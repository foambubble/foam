# Unlinked references (stub)

**[[todo]] This [[roadmap]] item needs more specification work.** 

If you're interested in working on it, please start a conversation in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues).

## Notes

One of Roam's big features is the ability to find all instances of a reference, create a page for it and update all the references to link to the new page.

Implementing this is on the [[roadmap]], but for the time being you can achieve similar things by:

- `Cmd` + `Shift` + `F` ( `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `F` on Windows ) to find all the references, e.g. "Cat food"
- `Cmd` + `Shift` + `H` ( `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `F` on Windows ) to replace them with [[cat-food]].
- Click any of the references to create a new note.
