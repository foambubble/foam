# Foam

**Foam** is a personal knowledge management and sharing system inspired by [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/), built on [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/).

You can use **Foam** for organising your research, keeping re-discoverable notes, writing long-form content and, optionally, publishing it to the web.

**Foam** is free, open source, and extremely extensible to suit your personal workflow. You own the information you create with Foam, and you're free to share it, and collaborate on it with anyone you want.

## How do I use Foam?

Whether you want to build a [Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) or a [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/), write a book, or just get better at long-term learning, **Foam** can help you organise your thoughts if you follow these simple rules:

1. Create a single **Foam** workspace for all your knowledge and research following the [Getting started](https://foambubble.github.io/foam#getting-started) guide .
2. Write your thoughts in markdown documents (I like to call them **Bubbles**, but that might be more than a little twee). These documents should be atomic: Put things that belong together into a single document, and limit its content to that single topic. ([source](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/#principles))
3. Use Foam's shortcuts and autocompletions to link your thoughts together with `[[wiki-links]]`, and navigate between them to explore your knowledge graph.
4. Get an overview of your **Foam** workspace using the [[Graph Visualisation](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/graph-visualisation)], and discover relationships between your thoughts with the use of [[Backlinking](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/backlinking)].

Foam is a like a bathtub: _What you get out of it depends on what you put into it._
