# Tags

You can add tags to your notes to categorize or link notes together.

## Creating a tag

There are two ways of creating a tag:

- Adding a `#tag` anywhere in the text of the note, for example: #my-tag1
- Using the `tags: tag1, tag2` yaml frontmatter [[note-properties]]. Notice `my-tag1` and `my-tag2` tags which are added to this document this way.

Tags can also be hierarchical, so you can have `#parent/child`.

## Using *Tag Explorer*

It's possible to navigate tags via the Tag Explorer panel. [[todo]]

Tags can also be visualized in the Foam Graph Explorer. See [[graph-visualization]] for more info including how to change the color of nodes representing tags.

## Styling tags

Inline tags can be styled using custom CSS with the selector `.foam-tag`. [[todo]] clarify styling process and show example

## Using backlinks in place of tags

Given the power of backlinks, some people prefer to use them as tags.
For example you can tag your notes about books with [[book]].

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[note-properties]: note-properties.md "Note Properties"
[todo]: ../../dev/todo.md "Todo"
[graph-visualization]: graph-visualization.md "Graph Visualization"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
