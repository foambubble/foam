# Tags

Foam supports tags.

## Creating a tag

There are two ways of creating a tag:

- adding a `#tag` anywhere in the text of the note
- using the `tags: tag1, tag2` property in frontmatter

## Navigating tags

It's possible to navigate tags via the Tag Explorer panel.
In the future it will be possible to explore tags via the graph as well.

## Styling tags
Inline tags can be styled using custom CSS with the selector `.foam-tag`.

## An alternative to tags

Given the power of backlinks, some people prefer to use them also as tags.
For example you can tag your notes about books with [[book]].
