# Developing documentation

The best way to develop docs for the Foam repo is to directly open the `$foam-repo/docs/` as the root folder in a new vscode window.
This automatically configures vscode with the necessary settings enabled (like [[link-reference-definitions]]) to effiniently write this documentation.

## Organization

The Foam documentation is organized into two areas:

* User docs, located at `$foam-repo/docs/user/*`, which are copied in their entirety into `$foam-template-repo/docs`.
* Developer docs, located at `$foam-repo/docs/dev/*`

New user docs should be added to the User docs folder in the main Foam repo, then copied over to the Foam Template repo.

> [[todo]]: Automate this process. Idea: github action to open a PR on any change to `/docs/user`

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[link-reference-definitions]: ../user/features/link-reference-definitions.md "Link Reference Definitions"
[todo]: todo.md "Todo"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
