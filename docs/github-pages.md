# Github Pages

- The [Foam template](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template) is **GitHub Pages** ready, all you have to do is [turn it on in your repository settings](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/).
- The default GitHub Pages template is called [Primer](https://github.com/pages-themes/primer). See Primer docs for how to customise html layouts and templates.
- GitHub Pages is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), so it supports things like permalinks, front matter metadata etc.
