# Including notes in a note

In some situations it might be useful to include the content of another note in your current note. Foam supports this displaying within the vscode environment. Note, this does not work out-of-the-box for your publishing solutions.

## Including a note

Including a note can be done by adding an `!` before a wikilink defintion. For example `![[wikilink]]`.

## Custom styling

Displaying the inclusion of notes allows for some custom styling, see [[custom-markdown-preview-styles]]

## Future possibilities

Work on this feature is evolving and progressing. See the [[inclusion-of-notes]] proposal for the current discussion.
