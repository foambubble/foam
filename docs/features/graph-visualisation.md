# Graph Visualisation

Foam comes with a graph visualisation.
The graph will:
- allow you to highlight a node by hovering on it, to quickly see how it's connected to the rest of your notes
- allow you to select one or more (by keeping `SHIFT` pressed while selecting) nodes by clicking on them, to better understand the structure of your notes
- to navigate to a note by clicking on it while pressing `CTRL` or `CMD`
- automatically center the graph on the currently edited note, to immediately see it's connections

### Markdown Links
Another extension that provides a great graph visualisation is [Markdown Links](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tchayen.markdown-links).
The extension doesn't use the Foam model, so discrepancies might arise, but it's a great visualisation extension nonetheless!

- Use the `Markdown Links: Show Graph` command to see the graph
