# Graph Visualization

Foam comes with a graph visualization of your notes.
To see the graph execute the `Foam: Show Graph` command.

Your files, such as notes and documents, are shown as the nodes of the graph along with the tags defined in your notes. The edges of the graph represent either a link between two files or a file that contains a certain tag. A node in the graph will grow in size with the number of connections it has, representing stronger or more defined concepts and topics.

## Graph Navigation

With the Foam graph visualization you can:

- highlight a node by hovering on it, to quickly see how it's connected to the rest of your notes
- select one or more (by keeping `shift` pressed while selecting) nodes by clicking on them, to better understand the structure of your notes
- navigate to a note by clicking on it's node while pressing `ctrl` or `cmd`
- automatically center the graph on the currently edited note, to immediately see its connections

## Filter View

If you only wish to view certain types of notes or tags, or want to hide linked attachment nodes then you can apply filters to the graph.

- Open the graph view using the `Foam: Show Graph` command
- Click the button in the top right corner of the graph view that says "Open Controls"
- Expand the "Filter By Type" dropdown to view the selection of types that you can filter by
- Uncheck the checkbox for any type you want to hide
- The types displayed in this dropdown are defined by [[note-properties]] which includes Foam-standard types as well as custom types defined by you!

## Custom Graph Styles

The Foam graph will use the current VS Code theme by default, but it's possible to customize it with the `foam.graph.style` setting.

![Graph style demo](../../assets/images/graph-style.gif)

A sample configuration object is provided below, you can provide as many or as little configuration as you wish:

```json
"foam.graph.style": {
    "background": "#202020",
    "fontSize": 12,
    "lineColor": "#277da1",
    "lineWidth": 0.2,
    "particleWidth": 1.0,
    "highlightedForeground": "#f9c74f",
    "node": {
        "note": "#277da1",
    }
}
```

- `background` background color of the graph, adjust to increase contrast
- `fontSize` size of the title font for each node
- `lineColor` color of the edges between nodes in the graph
- `lineWidth` thickness of the edges between nodes
- `particleWidth` size of the particle animation showing link direction when highlighting a node
- `highlightedForeground` color of highlighted nodes and edges when hovering over a node
- to style individual types of nodes jump to the next section: [Style Nodes By Type](#style-nodes-by-type)

### Style Nodes by Type

It is possible to customize the style of a node based on the `type` property in the YAML frontmatter of the corresponding document.

There are a few default node types defined by Foam that are displayed in the graph:

- `note` defines the color for regular nodes whose documents have not overriden the `type` property.
- `placeholder` defines the color for links that don't match any existing note. This is a [[placeholder]] because no file with such name exists.
  - see [[wikilinks]] for more info <!--NOTE: this placeholder link should NOT have an associated file. This is to demonstrate the custom coloring-->
- `tag` defines the color for nodes representing #tags, allowing tags to be used as graph nodes similar to backlinks.
  - see [[tags]] for more info
- `feature` shows an example of how you can use note types to customize the graph. It defines the color for the notes of type `feature`
  - see [[note-properties]] for details

For example the following `backlinking.md` note:

```markdown
---
type: feature
---
# Backlinking

...
```

And the following `settings.json`:

```json
"foam.graph.style": {
    "background": "#202020",
    "node": {
        "note": "#277da1",
        "placeholder": "#545454",
        "tag": "#f9c74f",
        "feature": "red",
    }
}
```

Will result in the following graph:

[note-properties]: note-properties.md "Note Properties"
[wikilinks]: wikilinks.md "Wikilinks"
[tags]: tags.md "Tags"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
