This is the VS Code extension for [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam).

> ℹ️ the extension doesn't do much on it's own. To learn how to use it, read [Foam documentation](https://foambubble.github.io/foam) and the [Getting started](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/#getting-started) guide.

> ⚠️ This is an early stage software. Use at your own peril.

> You can join the Foam Community on the [Foam Discord](https://discord.gg/EKFyMrVNZ9)

## Quick getting started

You really, _really_, **really** should read [Foam documentation](https://foambubble.github.io/foam), but if you can't be bothered, this is how to get started:

1. [Create a GitHub repository from foam-template](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/generate). If you want to keep your thoughts to yourself, remember to set the repository private.
2. Clone the repository and open it in VS Code.
3. When prompted to install recommended extensions, click **Install all** (or **Show Recommendations** if you want to review and install them one by one).

This will also install `Foam for VSCode`, but if you already have it installed, that's ok, just make sure you're up to date on the latest version.

## Features

- Connect your notes using `[[wiki-links]]`
- Create markdown references for `[[wiki-links]]` with the `Foam: Update Markdown Reference List` command, to use your notes in a non-foam workspace
- See how your notes are connected via a graph with the `Foam: Show Graph` command
- Tag your notes and navigate them with the Tag Explorer
- Make your notes navigable both in GitHub UI as well as GitHub Pages
- Explore your knowledge base with the `Foam: Open Random Note` command
