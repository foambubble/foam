# Materialized Backlinks (stub)

**[[todo]] This [[roadmap]] item needs more specification work.** 

If you're interested in working on it, please start a conversation in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues).

## Notes

The idea would be to automatically generate lists of backlinks (and optionally, also forward links) into the bottom of every markdown document to

- Make every link two-way navigable in published sites
- Make Foam notes more portable to different apps and long-term storage
