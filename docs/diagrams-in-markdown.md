# Diagrams in Markdown

You can use VS Code plugins such as [Mermaid](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid) to draw and preview diagrams in your content.

⚠️ Be aware that Mermaid diagrams don't automatically get rendered in published Foams in [[github-pages]], and would require you to eject to another static site generation approach that supports Mermaid plugins.
