# Github Pages

- The [Foam template](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template) is **GitHub Pages** ready, all you have to do is [turn it on in your repository settings](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/).
- The default GitHub Pages template is called [Primer](https://github.com/pages-themes/primer). See Primer docs for how to customise html layouts and templates.
- GitHub Pages is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), so it supports things like permalinks, front matter metadata etc.

## How to publish locally

If you want to test your published foam, follow the instructions:
- https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll
- https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll

Assuming you have installed ruby/jekyll and the rest:
- `touch Gemfile`
  - open the file and paste the following:
```
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem "github-pages", "VERSION"
```
replacing `VERSION` with the latest from https://rubygems.org/gems/github-pages (e.g. `gem "github-pages", "209"`)
- `bundle`
- `bundle exec jekyll 3.9.0 new .`
- edit the `Gemfile` according to the instructions at [Creating Your Site](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll#creating-your-site) Point n.8
- `bundle exec jekyll serve`
