# Git Integration

There are (too) many ways to commit your changes to source control:

- Using VS Code's own git integration
  - The quick and easy way is to use the `Git: Commit All` command after editing files. The default Foam workspace settings will stage & sync all of your changes to the remote:
- Using GitDoc for [[automatic-git-syncing]]
- Whatever way you like to do it (CLI?)
